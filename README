Some git hook scripts for keeping track of how much time was spent on each
commit.

The hooks are activated automatically but if you want to edit the time spent
note without executing `git commit` then you can do it with `git tst`.

`git tst total` displays the total accumulated by each user.

INSTALLATION
Clone this repository and keep it in a definitive place. When you install it to
each repository it will actually just link the hooks from where you cloned it
and keep referring to it. The reason to this is so you won't need to reinstall
the hooks to each repository again when you update the scripts.

./install_hooks <TARGET_REPOSITORY_PATH>
